I played a free alternative to the popular game "MINECRAFT" titled "MINECRAFT EDUCATION EDITION";
What I liked about this game was that I could import custom maps and game modes like bedwards and skywars in order to play as if I were on the original game;
I enjoyed playing skywars as it was fast paced and allowed for optimal fun in minimal time;
